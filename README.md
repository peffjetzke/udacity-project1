# Natural Language Procession and Webpack (Project 4)
The FEND Project 4 task was to use what we learned in Project 3 (API) and apply the lesson 4 lessons regarding the webpack plugin to emulate what working on a website with a large number of files might be like. The actual API, [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis), is used to read the content of a provided URL and provide feedback regarding its use of language for the following metrics:

-Score:
-Agreement:
-Subjectivity: 
-Confidence:
-Irony:

Details on these metrics can be found in the [MeaningCloud Response](https://learn.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis/2.1/doc/response) documentation.

## Running the Project

Running this project can be accomplished via the following commands in the terminal (do not include the quotes):

`npm run build-prod`
`npm start`

### Project Notes
This project was much more difficult than the those previous. Due to its reliance on many different plugins from different developers, as well as it being a first look at using such things, it was often difficult to know if you were having issues with compatibility between the various plugins or syntax/coding issues. Additionally, the addition of the very briefly touched on Service Workers and Jest, which had no lesson at all, added a high level of difficulty to much of the work.
